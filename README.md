# Rails Legacy App

In this lab you will dive into a mature rails application and attempt to fix some reported bugs. This lab will stretch your debugging skills and your ability to navigate a large rails project. We encourage you to tackle it in pairs.

> This Rails application has been intentionally broken!

### What's Publify?
You will be forking & cloning an open source (MIT LICENSE) blogging platform called Publify.

Publify is a simple but full featured web publishing software. It's built
around a blogging engine and a small message system connected to Twitter.

Publify follows the principles of the IndieWeb, which are self hosting your Web
site, and Publish On your Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere.

Publify has been around since 2004 and is the oldest Ruby on Rails open source
project alive.

## Getting Started: Installing Publify Locally

To install Publify you need the following:

- Ruby 2.0, 2.1 or 2.2
- Ruby On Rails 4.2.0
- A database engine, MySQL, PgSQL or SQLite3

- A compatible JavaScript installation for asset compilation. See [the execjs
  readme](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs#readme) for details.
- ImageMagick

#### Setup ImageMagick Dependency
Make sure that you have ImageMagick installed (used by mini_magick).

Check for imagemagick:
```bash
$ which convert
# /path/to/bin/convert
```

Install it if it's missing (this can take a few minutes):
```bash
$ brew update
$ brew link
$ brew install imagemagick
```

#### Setup Rails Application
Fork & Clone the Publify repo:

```bash
$ bundle install
$ rake db:setup
$ rake db:migrate
$ rails server
```

You can now launch you browser and access 127.0.0.1:3000.

You will be prompted to supply a blog title and email:

#### Seed your blog with posts & tags
```bash
$ rake db:seed
# => Seeded 24 articles...
```

#### Look around!
* Visit your blog homepage at `localhost:3000/`
* Go to the `/admin` backend and poke around (it's similar to wordpress).
* Create your first blog post!

##The Bugs

The following issues have been added to the main github repo. Please fix each bug on its own branch (e.g. `fix_sidebar_styles`).

> Please visit the `issues` section of this repo for more detailed bug descriptions + screenshots.

####Issue \#1: Inconsistent Sidebar Styles
* All titles in the sidebar should have `monospace` style font
* All bullets should be circles.

####Issue \#2: Top Month Always Empty (Archive Sidebar)
* When I click on the top-most month in the Archive Sidebar it says "No posts found...".
* When I create a post in the _current month_ (e.g. February) it displays a link in the sidebar for _next month_ (e.g. March), and says "No posts found..."

####Issue \#3: Months sorted incorrectly (Archive Sidebar)
The sort order of months in the Archive Sidebar is off, with January 2015 appearing directly above December 2015:

### Resolving the Issue

## Helpful Hints
* Use **Rubber Duck Debugging** -- Make sure you understand the issue!
* Use frequent **Sanity Checks**
    - What are you testing / what are you expecting?
* **Follow the trail**
    - How do you work backwards from the view to the server?
    - How do you find specific files in your rails application?
    - How do you find specific keywords or method calls?
* Sometimes you need to **resart the server** if the views you are working with are being cached.
